## Summary
At around 7pm April 8th 2025, hyrumcpizza.click (one of the premiere providers of JWT pizza) was effected by an outage of the customer's 
ability to purchase pizza. Their orders were unable to be fulfilled at the factory, and thus resulted in many unhappy customers and
untold millions lost in profit. Luckily our DevOps crew (some of the best in the business) worked tirelessly and were able to resolve this 
issue so now the application is back to its full functionality. 
## Detection
The problem was detected by the DevOps crew's OnCall Alerts set up through Grafana. They were sent a push notification that informed
them that there were an abnormal amount of pizza orders failing and they immediately began looking through their grafana logs and metrics
for clues. But mostly the problem was detected and figured out because of the amazing help of the TA.
