# The Wonderful World of HAR Files 
Ever since we used HAR files while developing a test with the Grafana K6 service and the main weight of developing those tests was shouldered by simply hitting the button to record a HAR file while one navigated the application as normal, I have come to really respect and admire the HAR file system for the ease of use and for making my life much simpler. Instead of havivng to painfully write out the sequence of requests, responses, and calls to endpoints all that important information is beautifully stored inside of a HAR file which you can then upload whenever. 
## The History of HAR Files  
The HAR file was developed and emerged in the late 2000s. This was in response to the fact that web pages and applications were continuing to grow more complex, and developers needed a way to capture browser activity beyond simple HTML loading. The HAR file's direct predecessor was Firebug. Firebug was a Mozilla Firefox extension that allowed some levels of HTTP traffic to be recorded, but there still wasn't a standardized way to store and export all that information in a file. The standardization of HAR was primarily driven by the Web Performance Working Group under the World Wide Web Consortium. 

The HAR format was formalized around 2009 and it used JSON as the basis for its underlying structure to store all the information necessary. The person who is credited with its final development is Jan Odvarko. Odvarko had worked for Mozilla Firefox on the Firebug extensions and other related projects. So it makes sense that he was such an integral part of the HAR format. 

With the advent of the HAR file, deeply informed records of web traffic could be made that included timings, HTTP Request and Response headers, payloads, redirects, and caching behaviors. Over time many browser vendors began to see the usefulness of the HAR file for development tools and began to add functionality to their respective services that allowed HAR files to be recorded and shared. Today all the major web browsing services (ie Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari) support creating and sharing HAR files. 

## How HAR Files Work 
Har files are created using browser developer tools. When a user chooses the option to begin recording a HAR file, the browser they're using logs every network request and response capturing all the information we've mentioned previously and other vital important information such as cookies and authentication tokens. The resulting Har file is a structured JSON document that can be exported and analyzed using HAR viewers or imported into performance tracking software (just like we did Grafana K6). 

## Weaknesses of HAR Files 
**Security Risks:** HAR files can store a lot of important security information (authentication tokens, personal information, session cookies) and if you're not careful you can accidentally create a scenario where this creates a security breach. Luckily often times there are options to sanitize your HAR file before exporting or doing important things with it. 
**Large file size**: Again because the HAR files store so much information, if you're making a recording over an extremely large web application the massive amounts of information will make the file size large, unwieldly, and difficult to look through for specific parts. 
**Inconsistent Implementation:** Different web browsers can sometimes put bugs and other inconsistencies into their recording of the HAR file which can lead to difficulties later when exporting the HAR file to a reader or a peformance analysis software. 
**Newer software not included:** Newer web application technologies (such as websockets) are not accounted for by HAR file records and so you might miss vital pieces of information that are communicted through new software when using HAR files. 


## Competing Technologies/ Newer Technologies Trying to Replace HAR files
**SAZ (Session Archive Zip):** SAZ files are compressed archives that can store more data efficiently, including binary content and session metadata. However, they are less universally supported than HAR so it will be a while until they replace HAR files if they do at all.
**Calls for better standardization/updates:** HAR files still remain the most ubiquitous form of browser recording file, but many people feel that it needs to be updated to take into account new emerging forms of software. 



** Conclusion 
In conclusion HAR files are the most widely used file to store information from web browsing, but could stand to have some updates to make them better and more applicable to the future of web application development. Either way they are an incredibly helpful technology that can provide a wealth of information concerning the processes of a web application.
